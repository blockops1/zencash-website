# Zen: Completely Secure Blockchain Currency

Zen is more than just a crypto-currency. It is a Bitcoin derived secure blockchain system designed for private transactions and communications worldwide.
What is Zen?
Distributed and Open-Source Crypto-Currency
Zen has a strong heritage of software development, inheriting the best of Zclassic, Zcash, and Bitcoin, and extended by inclusive governance, secure operations, and an active community.
Secure Communications with Zen Transactions
Zen eliminates the side channel communications of traditional crypto-currencies with secure person-to-person messages built into the shielded transactions. You can send a message with the money when you use Zen. 
Encrypted and Hardened Operations Infrastructure
Zen nodes and wallets communicate with certificate based encrypted traffic. Nodes are paid in Zen to maintain a high standard of security and availability. The Zen DAO and Foundation are paid in Zen to operate and improve Zen infrastructure.
